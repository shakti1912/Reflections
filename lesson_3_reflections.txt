When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share something with others.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because other contributers might add stuff that I am not sure of, so it is better to manually pull from remote.
