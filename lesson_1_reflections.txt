Diff makes it easy to compare files. If file is big, diff is very useful.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Easily go back to previous version if screwed up on new version.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pro - makes every change clear and why we did it.
cons - might make commit at wrong time and struggle after that.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because git is used for code and most of the times we have more than one files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
first git log which shows all the commits then choose one commit and type get diff firstID secondID -- this gives the difference 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because you can always go back.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
make different versions of every assignments I am gonna do.
